This project is a basic recipe website that links to various recipes.
The recipes used were referenced from https://www.allrecipes.com/

In this project I will have demonstrated the usage of many
HTML elements to form the structure of a basic website with various webpages.
This project lets me refresh my memory of basic html by practicing and 
using various html elements to build a basic website. In this project 
I practice using these elements to link to other pages on
my website, embed images, use headings and paragraphs, as well as 
utilize ordered and unordered lists with the proper tags.
