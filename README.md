# odin-recipes
This project is a basic recipe website that links to various recipes.
In this project I will have demonstrated the usage of many
HTML elements to form the structure of a basic website with various pages.
This project lets me practice using anchor elements to link to other 
pages on my website. I am also able to embed images in my webpages
and use attributes for my link and image elements. I show the use of
header elements to indicate the importance of various text headings.
I also utilize lists to show unordered and ordered lists my webpages
using the necessary elements and proper tags.
I am able to structure my website with the mentioned html elements.
