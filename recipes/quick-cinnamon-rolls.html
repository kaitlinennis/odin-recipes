        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Brush a 9-inch square baking dish with 2 tablespoons melted butter.
            </li>
            <li>
                Whisk flour, 2 tablespoons white sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Work 3 tablespoons softened
                butter into flour mixture using your hands. Beat milk and egg together in another bowl; pour into flour-butter
                mixture and stir with a rubber spatula until a soft dough forms.
            </li>
            <li>
                Turn dough out onto a floured work surface and roll dough into a 1/4-inch thick rectangle. Brush surface of dough 
                with 2 tablespoons melted butter.
            </li>
            <li>
                Whisk 1/2 cup white sugar, brown sugar, and cinnamon together in a small bowl. Sprinkle 1/2 of the cinnamon sugar
                mixture in the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle remaining cinnamon sugar over butter-brushed dough.
                Roll dough around filling to form a log; cut log into 18 rolls and place rolls in the prepared baking dish.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until rolls are set, 20 to 25 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Beat confectioners' sugar, cream cheese, 1/4 cup softened butter, and vanilla extract together in a bowl until
                frosting is smooth. Top hot cinnamon rolls with cream cheese frosting.
